      <xs:documentation> This section contains information regarding any advance directive
        pertaining to a patient and a reference to the most up to date supporting documents for the
        directives. This is used to describe such information as a patients resusitation status and
        the like. The type element is a codedValue object that is used to describe what kind of
        advance directive this is. This specification does not currently state a required code
        system such as SNOMED CT that should be used, this may change is future versions of the
        schema. The use of the codedValues attributes are optional but a system must at the very
        least include a free text description of the directive as the value of the type element. The
        date element denotes the date the directive was last updated. The optional custodian element
        describes the person who currently is responsible for maintaing the advance directive. As
        with most other hData sections there is a informationSource (where this data originated) and
        a free text narrative section defined for this element. The informationSource is optional.
